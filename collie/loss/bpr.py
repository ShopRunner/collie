    Parameters
    ----------
    positive_scores: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing predictions for known positive items of shape ``1 x batch_size``
    negative_scores: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing scores for a single sampled negative item of shape ``1 x batch_size``
    num_items: Any
        Ignored, included only for compatability with WARP loss
    positive_items: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing ids for known positive items of shape ``1 x batch_size``. This is only
        needed if ``metadata`` is provided
    negative_items: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing ids for randomly-sampled negative items of shape ``1 x batch_size``. This
        is only needed if ``metadata`` is provided
    metadata: dict
        Keys should be strings identifying each metadata type that match keys in
        ``metadata_weights``. Values should be a ``torch.tensor`` of shape (num_items x 1). Each
        tensor should contain categorical metadata information about items (e.g. a number
        representing the genre of the item)
    metadata_weights: dict
        Keys should be strings identifying each metadata type that match keys in ``metadata``.
        Values should be the amount of weight to place on a match of that type of metadata, with the
        sum of all values ``<= 1``.
        e.g. If ``metadata_weights = {'genre': .3, 'director': .2}``, then an item is:

        * a 100% match if it's the same item,

        * a 50% match if it's a different item with the same genre and same director,

        * a 30% match if it's a different item with the same genre and different director,

        * a 20% match if it's a different item with a different genre and same director,

        * a 0% match if it's a different item with a different genre and different director,
          which is equivalent to the loss without any partial credit
    mask: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Boolean vector used for masking loss terms for sequential recommendations

    Returns
    -------
    loss: torch.tensor

    Modified adaptive BPR loss function.

    Approximates WARP loss by taking the maximum of negative predictions for each user and sending
    this to BPR loss.
