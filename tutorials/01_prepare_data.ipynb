    "Before we can start building a deep learning recommendation algorithm, we will need data! \n",
    "\n",
    "The core of any Collie model is interactions data, which is a matrix where the **rows** are the users and the **columns** are the items. Since models in Collie are *implicit* recommendation models, the **values** of the matrix will be ``0`` if a user has not interacted with an item and ``1`` if they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most recommendation scenarios, there are large numbers of users and items, but most users will have interacted with only a small percentage of these items. In an effort to make optimal use of the available memory, we will use a **sparse** matrix to represent this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collie contains a variety of recommendation models based around collaborative filtering, a technique behind recommendations of the \"users who viewed this item also viewed these others\" variety. The tutorial series will walk you through building a simple movie recommender before exploring different improvements Collie offers. Now, on to films! \n",
    "\n",
    "### MovieLens 100K \n",
    "\n",
    "MovieLens 100K<sup>1</sup> is a benchmark dataset for recommendation algorithms showing a subset of users' viewing preferences for a subset of films. There are **942 users** and **1682 items** in the dataset, with **100,000** interactions total. Though this dataset can easily fit in memory without having to be represented with a sparse matrix, we will still go ahead and treat it like we would a larger dataset. MovieLens 100K is a great choice for quick interactive training on a CPU. If you have a GPU available, give MovieLens 1M or MovieLens 10M a try - Collie works seamlessly on either! \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important caveat is that MovieLens 100K data contains explicit ratings, meaning instead of a ``0``/``1`` system for the values of our interaction matrix, all users are given the opportunity to rate a movie on a 5-point scale. So, to start this toy-example, we'll treat each 4 or 5 rating as a ``1`` and everything else as a ``0``. \n",
